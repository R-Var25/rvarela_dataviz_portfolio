# Wireframes / Storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User Research 

## Target Audience
> The following details my approach in finding key individuals that will aid in perfecting the narrative through their insights. 

A seen in Part I, the audience I originally intended to target was the general movie-going public, specifically those in NYC, as the data would focus on the famous AMC Movie Theater in Times Square. This would reflect the narrative of how a declining industry could impact an entire neighborhood and its economy. However, while this was a very interesting avenue to explore, acquiring the numbers of a local movie theater is quite difficult as they are seen as proprietary information. So, in order to keep with theme of movie theaters, I decided to change my target audience. From now on, the people who I will adresses this project to will be AMC Theaters themselves, specifically the distribution side, as they are the ones who decide what films get released in their theaters (within the United States).

In class we were placed into groups and each reviewed each others work. My groupmates did agree with the change of my audience and to edit my story a bit more to appeal to the new audince. Overall, they liked and understood my visualizations, allowing me to see that people from other focuses were able to comprehend what was being protrayed.  


To better understand the effectivness of my visualizations, I decided to reach out to a couple of my friends to get a better persepctive on the narrative I am trying to tell. The first one is an actress who aspiers to be on the silver screen one day. The second is a computer scientist whose day job is correcting code and handling data. The third one is a bussiness student who is always looking for new creative solutions to problems that serve everyones best interest (the most profitable). I chose these three people as they each address a part of the story I want to tell, the creative aspect, the expression of data, and the business element. 


## Interview Script
 

### Goals:
> The following are three main goals I am trying to accomplish through my research:
 
1. To make sure the data and visualizations are comprehensible to all.
2. To determine if the story being told is cohesive and follows a natural progession. 
3. To see what parts stand out or not, and if there is anything that needs more emphasis within the whole narrative.  


### Questions to Ask: 

1. What are intial thoughts? What do you see? 
2. What story do you think is being told through the visuals? Does it come together to form a clear and compelling story? 
3. Is there anything that confusing or difficult to comprehend? Is there anything that draws away from the overall story?
4.  Is there anything that is intresting and stands out to you? Is there anything you would love to learn more about?
5.  What are final thoughts? Do you feel compelled by the whole thing, especially the final message?
