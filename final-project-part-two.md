# Storyboard 

## Introduction: 

I plan to open up with a personal annecdote on one of my fondest memories tied to the AMC Theater at Times Square. This would then tie into the examining of the entire neighborhood around the theater and the overall decline of the theatrical industry has impacted everyone on the local level. 

### Update:
Due to the change in audience for the project, I will no longer center the narrative on the theatrical industry and the health of Times Square and the community around it. However, I will use my memory of the movies in Time Square to engage with the audience, helping them remember a key memory of their time at the movies. It will allow everyone to connect and spread good feelings before the depressing information that will come later. 


## Rising Action:

There will be a shift in the story, as I ask those movie going public to come on a journey to see what the Movie Theater Industry currently looks like. We will take the joy from their childhood and build in suspense, placing the audinece on emotional roller coaster. 

### Update:
There will be NO CHANGE to this progression as it helps to build momementum for the call to action. 

## Climax:

We then show the audience a raw look at the current state of the theatrical industry. How a century old business is slowly crumbling away, being beaten by a beheamouth with exponental revenue growth and steady subscribership, Netflix. We are introducing them to a world where it is possible that there will be no movie theaters in a few years, leading to the loss of many jobs, the crumbling of neighborhoods, and the loss of a collective cultural experience. 

### Update:
While the overall progression won't change, the excecution of it will, as we now have a different audience. While we still focus on the possible loss of the movie theater experience, it will be more in the context of loosing revenue and jobs for AMC employees and shareholders. 


## Falling Action:

We begin to show the audinece what they can do to save the movie experience by showcasing recent viral moments inspired by them enagaging with the movies. 

### Update: 
We show our new audience the most successful Theatrical Releases post-COVID and paint a picture of a pattern they all have in common, they were all huge cutural events. This will be done by using social media posts of people attending these movies, show how the audience engages with these cultural events. 

## Call to Action: 

GO TO THE MOVIES!!!!!!

### Update:
Changed to: MAKE MOVIES AN EVENT! CREATE FOMO! WE ONLY LIVE ONCE, SO EXPEIRENCE ONE OF THE FEW COMMUNIAL CULTURAL MOMEMNTS LEFT.





# User Research 

## Target Audience
> The following details my approach in finding key individuals that will aid in perfecting the narrative through their insights. 

A seen in Part I, the audience I originally intended to target was the general movie-going public, specifically those in NYC, as the data would focus on the famous AMC Movie Theater in Times Square. This would reflect the narrative of how a declining industry could impact an entire neighborhood and its economy. However, while this was a very interesting avenue to explore, acquiring the numbers of a local movie theater is quite difficult as they are seen as proprietary information. So, in order to keep with theme of movie theaters, I decided to change my target audience. From now on, the people who I will adresses this project to will be AMC Theaters themselves, specifically the distribution side, as they are the ones who decide what films get released in their theaters (within the United States).

In class we were placed into groups and each reviewed each others work. My groupmates did agree with the change of my audience and to edit my story a bit more to appeal to the new audince. Overall, they liked and understood my visualizations, allowing me to see that people from other focuses were able to comprehend what was being protrayed.  


To better understand the effectivness of my visualizations, I decided to reach out to a couple of my friends to get a better persepctive on the narrative I am trying to tell. The first one is an actress who aspiers to be on the silver screen one day. The second is a computer scientist whose day job is correcting code and handling data. The third one is a bussiness student who is always looking for new creative solutions to problems that serve everyones best interest (the most profitable). I chose these three people as they each address a part of the story I want to tell, the creative aspect, the expression of data, and the business element. 


## Interview Script
 

### Goals:
> The following are three main goals I am trying to accomplish through my research:
 
1. To make sure the data and visualizations are comprehensible to all.
2. To determine if the story being told is cohesive and follows a natural progession. 
3. To see what parts stand out or not, and if there is anything that needs more emphasis within the whole narrative.  


### Questions to Ask: 

1. What are intial thoughts? What do you see? 
2. What story do you think is being told through the visuals? Does it come together to form a clear and compelling story? 
3. Is there anything that confusing or difficult to comprehend? Is there anything that draws away from the overall story?
4.  Is there anything that is intresting and stands out to you? Is there anything you would love to learn more about?
5.  What are final thoughts? Do you feel compelled by the whole thing, especially the final message? 



## Interview Findings
> Here are the findings that I gathered from the interviews. 

### Interview Answers

#### Interview 1: Actor 

1. My initial thoughts are that these graphs are comparing the declining performance of movies at movie theaters from the past several years compared to the steady increase of Netflix subscribers. The first graph compares the total gross of big box office successes from the past two decades; this serves to highlight a correlation between the colossal success of movie theater releases from the 2000s until the late 2010s to their steady decline post-2020. The second graph shows the increase in Netflix revenue from 2017-2024. The third graph compares the steady amount of subscribers maintained by Netflix versus the steep decline in AMC attendance, which has slowly increased in the years following the pandemic but has never returned to its pre-pandemic high. 

2. What I gathered from these graphs is the biggest box office performers had the largest total gross for films released prior to 2019. In 2020, movie theaters like AMC saw a steep decline in attendance due to theaters shutting down during the COVID-19 pandemic. Attendance never returned to it’s pre-pandemic high, while Netflix has steadily gained subscribers over the past several years. It tells a clear and compelling story; Netflix has maintained a steady amount of subscribers that sustained through the pandemic due to its lower cost and the convenience of being able to watch from anywhere. AMC, on the other hand, lost audiences that it has never been able to fully recoup in the years following the pandemic.

3. I was able to follow along with the story these graphs were trying to tell just fine. The graphs are concise and highlight the continued steady success of Netflix with the decline in movie theater attendance. 

4. Something that stood out to me that this graph made clear is how even big box offices successes in the years following the pandemic never quite reached the total gross that successful movies gained prior to the pandemic. Even films like Barbie and Inside Out 2 that became cultural phenomenons didn’t outperform films that came out in the latter half of the 2010s like Finding Dory and Star Wars Episode VIII. One additional bit of info that might be interesting to include could be the cost of Netflix over this time versus the price of movie theater tickets during this same time period. How many people are now waiting for these movies to come out on Netflix and streaming instead due to the cost of movie tickets?

5. Overall, these graphs tell a compelling story about the rise of streaming services and the decline in movie theater attendance. As someone who loves going to the movies, I find this story particularly compelling because I worry about losing the magic of experiencing films for the first time and the magic and connection that comes when you experience that with other human beings.


#### Interview 2: Computer Scientist 

1. Title is descriptive and helps me understand what the graph is of. The clusters are also easy to visualize.
  
2. Together the visuals tell a story of changing entertainment industry dynamics—traditional box office successes contrasted with the rise of streaming giants. The contrast between the scatter of yearly blockbusters and the consistent climb of Netflix revenue makes the story clear and impactful.
   
3. The bubble chart does not have axis labels. And for the Line chart, the label “Avg. Revenue in Millions” could be more specific- as in if it is talking about AMC’s revenue or total revenue.
  
4. How Netflix's revenue outpaces AMC’s so dramatically, especially after 2018. It shows a clear turning point in consumer behavior. I’d be curious to learn about what content or strategies fueled Netflix’s biggest revenue jumps and how AMC tried to respond during those years.
  
5. The visuals together paint a strong picture of how audience preferences and industry revenue streams have evolved over time. The contrast between box office hits and streaming growth leaves a lasting impression about the shifting future of entertainment.



#### Interview 3: Business Student  

1. It seems like while box office has been dominating the past decade, this has now changed with the rise of Netflix. The popularity of box office is falling while it seems like Netflix is gaining more in revenue and subscribers.
   
2. Theaters should find a way to gain back its past glory. Yes.
   
3. No. No.
   
4. It was interesting to see theaters were able to bounce back a little after Covid but the questions remains if it could go back to the way it is before.  Maybe a final picture to tie in the overall message together.
   
5. The graphs provides a final message showing that box office has been on the decline while streaming has been on the rise. Personally, no because I don’t go to theaters to begin with. 
 



# Identified Changes for Part III


## Research Synthesis
> Some observations gathered from the conducted interviews.

There was a positive sentiment from the visualizations that common between all three interviews. Having people of different disciples and perspectives really did help with understanding where the narrative is strong and where it needs to be improved on. 

The overall message recieved from each interviewe was that the all understood what each visual was showcasing and how they tied into the overall narrative of the declining movie theater industry in contrast to the rise of streaming, in this case Netflix. They were able to comprehend that movie theater revenue has been on the decline throughout the past decade and that viewership has not been consistent. Meanwhile, Netflix's revnue has increased exponetially and its subscribers keep on grown consistently. They were particulary interested in the notable differences between pre-COVID movie going and post-COVID movie going and how that has played a huge factor in the undoing of a century old business. 

While most of the comments were positive, there were some suggestions made that could improve the overall story telling and help make the call to action that much stronger. The first suggestion was to edit the visualizations a bit more, spefically to have more clear labels for each axis. The second would be the further depth of provided context, as while there is enough information provided to understand what is being shown, it is still taking a lot of time to think, making it a bit more difficult to fully comprehend the final message and take in the call to action. The third suggestion would be using more visual aids besides graphs to better express the story being told, as while the graphs are powerful, having them one after another with no room in between can be overwhelming. 

One interviewe brought up a question on seeing the cost differences between Netflix subscriptions and Movie Tickets over the decade could add another element on the decline of movie theaters. So, I could add another graph abou that later if I choose to lean towards the finacial aspects of my call to action. The call to action was popular and made impact on most of my interview subjects, as it got them to start to think about what still makes them go to the movies. (All except one who rarely ever goes out.) 





## Anticipated Changes for Part III  

The critiques I recieved were quite constructive, letting me know what I need to address to have a better and more cohesive story to tell. There are three main thing that I will be ammending:
1. Refer back and see if each axis is doing its job.
2. Providing deeper context to the data being showcased on the graph.
3. Choosing more enagaing visual. Perhaps having an ending photo or visualization that sums up the entire story and ties everything together at the end.

As I said in Part 1, my intial storytelling method of choice was a Tableau Dashboard of different data visualizations. However, after all the feedback from the interviews, I have decided it would be in my best interest to switch to Shorthand, as it allows me space to express all the avenues I wish to explore. Nevertheless, there are still many complecations to this. I have had a hisory of issues with embedding in the past. So, I will need to have a contingency plan if my graphs are having issues with another platform. For these cases, I will be shore to take screenshots of my work and place them on the presentation so they at least can be seen. I will then provide the link for each graph, allowing the audinece to interact with the data being showcased. 

For Part III, my current game plan is to ploish up my current visualizations and possibly add one of two more to round out the story. I will complete my Shorthand presentation and prepare to showcase my work in front of the class.
