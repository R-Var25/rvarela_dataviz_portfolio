# Wireframes / Storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

## Storyboard 

Introduction: 

I planned to open up with a personal annecdote on one of my fondest memories tied to the AMC Theater at Times Square








# User Research 

## Target Audience
> The following details my approach in finding key individuals that will aid in perfecting the narrative through their insights. 

A seen in Part I, the audience I originally intended to target was the general movie-going public, specifically those in NYC, as the data would focus on the famous AMC Movie Theater in Times Square. This would reflect the narrative of how a declining industry could impact an entire neighborhood and its economy. However, while this was a very interesting avenue to explore, acquiring the numbers of a local movie theater is quite difficult as they are seen as proprietary information. So, in order to keep with theme of movie theaters, I decided to change my target audience. From now on, the people who I will adresses this project to will be AMC Theaters themselves, specifically the distribution side, as they are the ones who decide what films get released in their theaters (within the United States).

In class we were placed into groups and each reviewed each others work. My groupmates did agree with the change of my audience and to edit my story a bit more to appeal to the new audince. Overall, they liked and understood my visualizations, allowing me to see that people from other focuses were able to comprehend what was being protrayed.  


To better understand the effectivness of my visualizations, I decided to reach out to a couple of my friends to get a better persepctive on the narrative I am trying to tell. The first one is an actress who aspiers to be on the silver screen one day. The second is a computer scientist whose day job is correcting code and handling data. The third one is a bussiness student who is always looking for new creative solutions to problems that serve everyones best interest (the most profitable). I chose these three people as they each address a part of the story I want to tell, the creative aspect, the expression of data, and the business element. 


## Interview Script
 

### Goals:
> The following are three main goals I am trying to accomplish through my research:
 
1. To make sure the data and visualizations are comprehensible to all.
2. To determine if the story being told is cohesive and follows a natural progession. 
3. To see what parts stand out or not, and if there is anything that needs more emphasis within the whole narrative.  


### Questions to Ask: 

1. What are intial thoughts? What do you see? 
2. What story do you think is being told through the visuals? Does it come together to form a clear and compelling story? 
3. Is there anything that confusing or difficult to comprehend? Is there anything that draws away from the overall story?
4.  Is there anything that is intresting and stands out to you? Is there anything you would love to learn more about?
5.  What are final thoughts? Do you feel compelled by the whole thing, especially the final message? 



## Interview Findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

### Interview Answers

#### Interview 1: Actor 






#### Interview 2: Computer Scientist 

1. Title is descriptive and helps me understand what the graph is of. The clusters are also easy to visualize.
2. Together the visuals tell a story of changing entertainment industry dynamics—traditional box office successes contrasted with the rise of streaming giants. The contrast between the scatter of yearly blockbusters and the consistent climb of Netflix revenue makes the story clear and impactful.
3. The bubble chart does not have axis labels. And for the Line chart, the label “Avg. Revenue in Millions” could be more specific- as in if it is talking about AMC’s revenue or total revenue
4. How Netflix's revenue outpaces AMC’s so dramatically, especially after 2018. It shows a clear turning point in consumer behavior. I’d be curious to learn about what content or strategies fueled Netflix’s biggest revenue jumps and how AMC tried to respond during those years.
5. The visuals together paint a strong picture of how audience preferences and industry revenue streams have evolved over time. The contrast between box office hits and streaming growth leaves a lasting impression about the shifting future of entertainment.



#### Interview 3: Business Student  

1. It seems like while box office has been dominating the past decade, this has now changed with the rise of Netflix. The popularity of box office is falling while it seems like Netflix is gaining more in revenue and subscribers. 
2. Theaters should find a way to gain back its past glory. Yes. 
3. No. No.
4. It was interesting to see theaters were able to bounce back a little after Covid but the questions remains if it could go back to the way it is before.  Maybe a final picture to tie in the overall message together.
5. The graphs provides a final message showing that box office has been on the decline while streaming has been on the rise. Personally, no because I don’t go to theaters to begin with.
