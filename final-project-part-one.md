# Outline
> Summary of the project.  

One of the most memorable experiences in my childhood was going to the movies. After getting into a velvet chair, rummaging for 45 seconds looking for the biggest popcorn kernel, the lights go down, and you get transported into another world. That experience, that pure bliss, is the reason why I decided to dedicate my life to the entertainment industry. If I were able to do that for someone, make at least one person's day, then my life would be complete. However, to have others experience and share that feeling, there needs to be movie theaters. My fondest movie moments have taken place in one particular theatre, the AMC at Times Square. That is where I spent countless hours diving into the worlds of Pandora, Middle Earth, and Atlantis. While I usually avoid Times Square like the plague, that movie theater holds a special place in my heart and for many other New Yorkers. 

The Entertainment Industry has been in turmoil over the past couple of years with the pandemic, the streaming wars, strikes, and now AI. The whole industry has been turned upside down more than once throughout the past decade. However, the one part of the industry that has suffered the most has been movie theaters. Movie theater attendance has been decreasing over the years, which has led to a decrease in revenue, leading to the decline of the movie theater experience. The world is changing, and theatrical movies are facing far more competition than before, some of which are coming from within, streaming services, which leaves theaters out to dry. Movie theaters are on their way to becoming a dying medium, which is terrifying, as many jobs and neighborhoods still depend on them, and whether people want to admit it or not, they still play a huge role within pop culture. 

My final project will showcase the troubling landscape of movie theaters in the US market, specifically AMC Theaters, and how they have been struggling in this new age. However, it will not all be doom and gloom. The first part of this project would be a road down memory lane, having people remember and connect with movie theaters again. Once they are all happy and giddy, the problem comes knocking, breaking their hearts as they learn about the dire state of the industry and how it will affect movie theaters, leading to their possible decline and extinction. This will be done through a closer look at how they got to this stage with the rise of streaming, specifically Netflix, contrasting those ever-increasing metrics to the ever-decreasing ones of movie theaters. It will point out the sheer magnitude of the cultural shift the audience has participated in without their knowledge, and how they have unknowingly contributed to the decline of an art form we all hold dear. This would then lead to the end of the project, a call to action to go to the movies, a message that everyone can get behind! We, the audience, can revive the movies, make them great once again, and experience new worlds one screening at a time. This would send a message to everyone, reigniting the hope of a new possible boom of theaters once again, just like in the golden age. 

Current Brainstorming: 
There would be one aspect of the project that would be highly centralized among a particular set of movie theaters, the AMCs of NYC. This part of the project would tie back to my roots and childhood, reexamining the theater scene of my memories and how it has changed over the years. It would further analyze how that change has impacted the overall sales and revenue, which plays a major role in the health of the neighborhood it resides. It would be more of a case study on how the decline of movie theaters impacts the streets and everyday life, further empowering the call to action.

# The Data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

To convey the decline of the movie theater over the past decade, one must have evidence. The evidence in this case would be the data sources documenting the declining sales and attendance of movie theaters. Since movie theaters themselves are a global industry, it would be too wide a scope to cover the entire planet and downright impossible. So, to come up with a better, more comprehensible story, I decided to put focus on the United States, as they are the largest box office and content producer of the Western World, with many of their films becoming worldwide staples. So, to see the decline in the theater business, we will first take a look at the domestic box office over the past decade. This would then be followed by a look at the number of AMC Theaters over the past decade and the number of tickets sold at these theaters over the same amount of time. Lastly, we will examine the yearly revenue of AMC as a whole and how it has performed over the past decade. 

To fully grasp the magnitude of the dismal performance of movie theaters, there needs to be something to compare it to. This is where Netflix comes to play. It is common knowledge that streaming has become the preferred method of entertainment for many. This is in sharp contrast to the past, where movie theaters were the main source of entertainment for films. Streaming has been pulling in significant numbers over the year, steadily increasing in both viewership and revenue. This is something that many members of the audience know of and have contributed to in some way. By putting all the information on display, the audience can see how a substantial change in habits could lead to the death of an entire medium if they do not act. By showing how gigantic and rich Netflix is, it would help inspire them to support their movie theaters, or else their key memories and experiences will not be there for the next generation. 

Cuurent Brainstorming:
The centralized part of my project will focus on the movie theater scene in NYC and how it interacts with the neighborhood it resides. There are many AMC Theaters in NYC. However, there is one that will always hold a special place in my heart: Times Square. However, it has been quite a difficult task to collect data on that particular theater. To combat this, I am exploring any other possible data sets that will provide the information I need, or I will change my focus to another AMC in the NYC Metroplitan Area.

# Method and Medium


This final project will be completed through the use of Tableau, specifically a Tableau dashboard. The reason that I chose Tableau is that it is a great tool for synthesizing data, allowing me to choose the points that I want to highlight, which in turn lets me tell the narrative I want. The use of the dashboard feature allows me to use multiple data visualizations, with each addressing a certain part of the overall story I am trying to tell, such as the contrast in movie theater numbers and Netflix subscribers and the revenue of NYC theaters over the years. While it would be great to publish these data visualizations from Tableau to ShortHand, I am still concerned about the FERPA Consent, as I would like my work to be private and only showcased to those whom I grant access to. If that issue is to be addressed, then I would be open to publishing my project on ShortHand.
