# The Final Data Story

Here is the final story!

# Changes made since Part II
> There were a couple of changes that were made since Part II.  

## The Audience
The audience for my data story was the part that changed the most throughout the project. The initial audience I had in mind was local New Yorkers, with the end goal of encouraging them to visit their local movie theater, in this case, the AMC Times Square, more often to help keep it in business. However, once the search for such data proved fruitless, I decided to change the audience to the theater companies themselves, in this case, AMC. This was going to be my final audience, but after discussing my friends and fellow MEIMs, I realized that there are many different sides to the theatrical business as well. This led to the conclusion that it would not be wise to address this presentation to the entire AMC Corporation. So, I narrowed my scope further to those directly involved with the films themselves, the theatrical distribution and marketing team at AMC. I feel that this research would benefit the team the most, as they are the ones with the capability to act on the findings being presented. I wanted to show both the trend to follow and how it can benefit the company in the long run.   

## Data Visualizations 
One of the main critiques I got for one of my data visualizations, the bubble chart, was that it was too broad in scope. The original concept I had was to showcase the decline in the strength of the US box office over the past two decades. This created another problem, as there was now too much information to keep up with and analyze, taking away focus from the main story I wanted to tell: movie theaters post-COVID and their struggle to remain relevant. To address this issue, I decided to narrow the scope to the past decade, focusing on blockbusters released between 2010 and a somewhat 2024/2025 timeframe. This not only brought much-needed levity to the audience but also further highlighted the differences between the pre-COVID movie theater world and the post-COVID movie theater world. 

The big theme in all the critiques and comments I received was to narrow the scope of my research and project. As I narrowed down my audience, I also realized that I needed to refine my data visuals accordingly. To further appeal to my audience, I created additional data visualizations that would better aid them in understanding the overarching narrative. The first one I added was a timeline of the critical dates in movie theater history, as it demonstrates that this is a century-old industry that has survived through many world-changing events before, providing hope that it can do so again. The second visual added was the increase in TV size over time, setting the stage for the fact that consumer habits have changed, which is the main competition that AMC is facing, not other theaters. The third and final visualization was the average theatrical to digital distribution pipeline, in days, along with a personal anecdote of my father's home theater. This also showcased that theaters are no longer the only game in town, and that in a digital age and struggling economy, AMC cannot compete as it has in the past. 

(There was also a theme of embedding issues with my Tableau visualizations throughout the entire project. To ensure the graphs were visible to the audience, I took two steps. The first thing I did was to provide an interactive Tableau dashboard, which they can fully visualize and interact with by clicking the full-screen option. The second thing I did was to include screenshots for audience members who do not care about the interactivity, but still want to see the data being presented. Overall, this approach provides the best of both worlds for the audience, allowing them to choose how they interact with the data. 


## Call to Action 
The call to action changed from "Please Go to the Movies" to "Let's Make the Movies a Party"! There are also now links, in the form of buttons, to examples of how this mission is currently being implemented with movies and their distributors in select locations, as well as the success of these events.  

## Design and Outline
As this was a project based on film and movie theaters, it was only fitting to follow the cinematic story structure to the letter, telling my movie's story through a presentation. The addition of my anecdotes made the whole presentation have more stakes, as I showed my care for this declining platform and why I want to save it. The overall design aligned with the use of a cinematic story structure, as the images I chose best reflected the mood being depicted, not only through my words but also through the data visualizations themselves. 


# Final Thoughts

Overall, this was a truly enlightening experience, as I was able to step out of my comfort zone and envision myself in fields I had never considered before. As a consumer of movies, I have often said that Hollywood's biggest problem is that it never listens to the data, i.e., it doesn't heed its customers' preferences. Through developing this product, I was able to learn more about consumer preferences and behaviors, as well as their impacts on the entertainment industry and the declining theatrical model. This project will aid me in future analysis of consumer preferences when deciding on a project to pursue in my career path within the entertainment industry.
