# About me
Hello! My name is Rebeca Amanda Varela (She/Her) and I am a born and raised New Yorker. While I'm originally from the Bronx, I grew up all over the city, from Washington Heights to Chinatown. I spent all my life in the greatest city in the world, including my undergrad at The City College of New York, where I double majored in Economics, with a focus in Finance, and Theatre, minoring in English. 

I am part of the Masters of Entertainment Industry Management (MEIM) program at Heinz at Carnegie Mellon University. Ever since I was small, I have always loved the art form of story-telling regardless of what medium it is told in. Movies have been there for every single milestone of my life, bringing joy to many dark times. With the entertainment industry constricting and relying more and more on technology, I still want to aid in giving those same smiles to the next generation, which is becoming more and more dependent on data for every decision.

My prior experience has trained me to see both the creative and analytical lenses of each situation. While I do not have much technical experience, I am always open to learning new skills, as in life we never stop learning. I am looking forward to everything that Telling Stories with Data will teach on data visualizations and how they can enhance narratives for everyone to understand. I invite you to browse my work and welcome you to this eclectic portfolio! 


# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. However, there are three main objectives I want to achieve at the end of this course.  

1. Being able to recognize different types of data visualizations and decipher when to use them. 
2. Understand how to utilize design elements to enhance the narrative you want to tell. 
3. Being able to create visualizations that effectively communicate my message to all people, not just those in the industry.

I am currently interested in working in the world of Film and Television through development and acquisitions, with a specialization in adaptations of prior existing media such as novels and games. However, I am open to working in a multitude of industries and disciplines, as I have way too many interests that I would like to follow.     

# UPDATE: Post Course

## Tools
The following are the tools we used throughout the entire course:
1. Tableau
2. Github
3. Data Wrapper
4. Basic Design Principles
5. Basic HTML and CS
6. Various Critique Methodologies

## What I learned
The main takeaway from this class is that data is not meant to be gatekept for those with years of experience. Data is everywhere, and it is always telling us about the world we live in. There is always a story waiting to be told, and there is always evidence to enhance what is being told. This course also emphasized the importance of details, such as how the use of the wrong color could throw off your entire narrative, defeating the purpose entirely. While my career aspirations are not in tech, I will utilize the skills I have learned to sharpen my toolbox and better improve the creative industries I aspire to be a part of.
