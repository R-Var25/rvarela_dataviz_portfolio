# About me
Hello! My name is Rebeca Amanda Varela (She/Her) and I am a born and raised New Yorker. While I'm originally from the Bronx, I grew up all over the city, from Washington Heights to Chinatown. I spent all my life in the greatest city in the world, including my undergrad at The City College of New York, where I double majored in Economics, with a focus in Finance, and Theatre, minoring in English. 

I am part of the Masters of Entertainment Industry Management (MEIM) program at Heinz at Carnegie Mellon University. Ever since I was small, I have always loved the art form of story-telling regardless of what medium it is told in. Movies have been there for every single milestone of my life, bringing joy to many dark times. With the entertainment industry constricting and relying more and more on technology, I still want to aid in giving those same smiles to the next generation, which is becoming more and more dependent on data for every decision.

My prior experience has trained me to see both the creative and analytical lenses of each situation. While I do not have much technical experience, I am always open to learning new skills, as in life we never stop learning. I am looking forward to everything that Telling Stories with Data will teach on data visualizations and how they can enhance narratives for everyone to understand. I invite you to browse my work and welcome you to this eclectic portfolio! 


# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. However, there are three main objectives I want to achieve at the end of this course.  

1. Being able to recognize different types of data visualizations and decipher when to use them. 
2. Understand how to utilize design elements to enhance the narrative you want to tell. 
3. Being able to create visualizations that effectively communicate my message to all people, not just those in the industry.

I am currently interested in working in the world of Film and Television through development and acquisitions, with a specialization in adaptations of prior existing media such as novels and games. However, I am open to working in a multitude of industries and disciplines, as I have way too many interests that I would like to follow.

## Telling Stories with Data

Telling Stories with Data had us create different data visualizations to enhance diverse narratives. Here is what we have made in the course.  

### First Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

### Second Assignment: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

### Final Project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 

#### Final Project: Part 1
[Part I](final-project-part-one)

#### Final Project: Part 2
[Part II](final-project-part-two)

#### Final Project: Part 3
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
